## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Warm Gold (#FFC107) to evoke growth, value, and the Kenyan spirit. This color symbolizes the potential for harvest and development within the Life Ministry's work.
- Background color: Pale Sand (#FAF9F6), providing a neutral and clean backdrop to ensure legibility, especially important in areas with varying light conditions and for users with lower digital literacy.
- Accent color: Muted Olive Green (#A3B18A) to complement the warm gold, symbolizing life, nature, and the agricultural landscape of Kenya, reinforcing the concept of growth and discipleship.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif font, balances modern aesthetics with a touch of warmth, making it readable and accessible for users of varying literacy levels.
- Use clear and representative icons, supplemented with text labels, to aid users with low literacy levels. Icons should be intuitive and culturally relevant to represent various activities and metrics.
- Optimize layouts for small screens and low-data usage, considering that many users will be accessing the app on basic smartphones with limited bandwidth.
- Subtle animations should provide feedback to user actions, but kept to a minimum to conserve battery life and data usage.
